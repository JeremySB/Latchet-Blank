# Latchet & Blank
Latchet & Blank is the second of three 3D games created for COMP 446A: Advanced Game Design at Grove City College. This game was created over several weeks as we experimented with a somewhat unique style of movement for a shooter game - the player cannot walk, only "latch" onto various walls.
